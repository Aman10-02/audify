0	13000	Goin' out tonight, changes into something red
13000	17000	Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
17000	21000	Everything she never had, she's showing up
24000	29000	Driving too fast, Moon is breaking through her ear
29000	33000	She said if something that she won't forget
33000	38000	Haven't no regrets, it's all that she really wants
41000	45000	Only getting on the baby
45000	49000	And I've been thinking about Leyla
49000	52000	Does it ever drive you crazy?
52000	55000	Just how fast the night
55000	61000	Chained us everything that you've ever dreamed of
61000	65000	Is superior in when you wake up
65000	68000	What there's nothing to be afraid of
68000	77000	Even when I change us, it will never change me
77000	84000	Just in the night, doubts are running around her head
84000	88000	He's bleeding, hearts behind a cigarette
88000	93000	Hot as big a loud and she doesn't want it to start
93000	100000	Moving too fast, Moon is lighting up a skin
100000	104000	She's falling, doesn't even know we yet
104000	111000	Haven't no regrets, it's all that she really wants
112000	117000	Only getting on the baby
117000	121000	And I've been thinking about Leyla
121000	124000	Does it ever drive you crazy?
124000	129000	Just how fast the night changes
129000	133000	Everything you've ever dreamed of
133000	137000	Disappearing when you wake up
137000	140000	What there's nothing to be afraid of
140000	152000	Even when I change us, it will never change me and you
152000	160000	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
160000	165000	Though we're now tonight, changes into something res
165000	168000	Her mother does it like that kind of
168000	174000	Trans reminder of the missing piece of innocent she loves
175000	179000	Only getting on the baby
179000	183000	Nothing thinking about Leyla
183000	186000	Does it ever drive you crazy?
186000	191000	Just how fast the night changes
191000	195000	Everything you've ever dreamed of
195000	199000	Disappearing when you wake up
199000	203000	What there's nothing to be afraid of
203000	211000	Even when I change us, everything you've ever dreamed of
211000	215000	Disappearing when you wake up
215000	219000	What there's nothing to be afraid of
219000	225000	Even when I change us, it will never change
225000	230000	Baby, you'll never change baby
230000	235000	You'll never change me and you
