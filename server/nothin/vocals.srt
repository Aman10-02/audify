1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Goin' out tonight, changes into something red

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Everything she never had, she's showing up

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Driving too fast, Moon is breaking through her ear

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
She said if something that she won't forget

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Haven't no regrets, it's all that she really wants

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Only getting on the baby

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And I've been thinking about Leyla

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Does it ever drive you crazy?

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Just how fast the night

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Chained us everything that you've ever dreamed of

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Is superior in when you wake up

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What there's nothing to be afraid of

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Even when I change us, it will never change me

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Just in the night, doubts are running around her head

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
He's bleeding, hearts behind a cigarette

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Hot as big a loud and she doesn't want it to start

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Moving too fast, Moon is lighting up a skin

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
She's falling, doesn't even know we yet

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Haven't no regrets, it's all that she really wants

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Only getting on the baby

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And I've been thinking about Leyla

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Does it ever drive you crazy?

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Just how fast the night changes

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Everything you've ever dreamed of

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Disappearing when you wake up

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What there's nothing to be afraid of

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Even when I change us, it will never change me and you

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Though we're now tonight, changes into something res

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Her mother does it like that kind of

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Trans reminder of the missing piece of innocent she loves

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Only getting on the baby

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Nothing thinking about Leyla

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Does it ever drive you crazy?

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Just how fast the night changes

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Everything you've ever dreamed of

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Disappearing when you wake up

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What there's nothing to be afraid of

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Even when I change us, everything you've ever dreamed of

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Disappearing when you wake up

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What there's nothing to be afraid of

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Even when I change us, it will never change

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Baby, you'll never change baby

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You'll never change me and you
